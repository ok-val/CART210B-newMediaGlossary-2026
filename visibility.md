## Visibility

In the context of new media, visibility refers to the condition of being seen, recognized, and made present within digital networks. It is not only physical sight, but algorithmic exposure: the degree to which individuals, ideas, images, and data circulate across platforms such as social media, search engines, and streaming services. Visibility determines who is seen, heard, and which narratives gain legitimacy. In digital environments, to exist socially often means to be visible.

Historically, visibility has been tied to power. In earlier times, public visibility was associated with spectacle and surveillance, a dynamic theorized by Michel Foucault through the metaphor of the Panopticon[^michelf]. Later, new media expanded the scale of visibility, enabling centralized institutions to shape public perception. The general public now thus link visibility with representation: marginalized groups fought to be visible in mainstream media as a matter of political recognition.

Technologically, new media transforms visibility through digitization, data tracking, and algorithmic sorting. Surveillance capitalism monetizes visibility by turning user behavior into data, feeding recommendation engines and targeted advertising[^terranova]. What is visible is shaped not only by users but also by opaque platform logics.

Due to the significant impact of new media on society, invisibility often links to marginalization, exclusion, and powerlessness. Those who remain unseen may struggle to participate fully in social, political, and economic life. Many organizations strive to ensure marginalized groups' presence in the cyberspace, one of which being AbTeC from Concordia[^abtec].

In contemporary media culture, visibility influences identity formation, activism, and social value. Online presence can generate cultural capital, economic opportunity, or political mobilization. Yet visibility also carries risks: harassment, data exploitation, and performative pressure. The paradox of new media visibility lies in its dual nature: it promises empowerment through exposure while embedding users within systems of control. Thus, visibility today is both a resource and a site of struggle, structuring how society perceives, governs, and connects itself in networked space.
