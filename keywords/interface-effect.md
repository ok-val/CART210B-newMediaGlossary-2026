## **Interface Effect**

The *interface effect* is a term from Alexander R. Galloway’s book *The Interface Effect* (2012).[^1]
Instead of thinking of an interface like a website, app, or game screen; think of it as a neutral window 
we look through to access content, Galloway suggests that interfaces are guiding us in how we experience media.
In other words, they don’t just show us things, they shape what we see, how we act, and how we think about that media [^2]
Galloway’s point is that an interface isn’t just a tool. It’s a 'structure of possibilities and limits'.
It decides what is visible, what is clickable, what actions are easy or impossible, and even what feels “normal” or
expected when we use digital systems. Interfaces set the 'rules of engagement' without us necessarily noticing, and this 
is what he calls the *interface effect*, the influence the interface has on behavior and meaning.
For example, social media feeds, infinite scrolling, autoplay buttons, notifications, and recommended content don’t
just happen by accident. They are part of the interface design that guides your attention and decisions. The interface
makes some actions feel natural, like scrolling forever, and makes others harder, like finding your settings or deleting
an account. As one reviewer puts it, Galloway shows us that interfaces are cultural and political environments,not invisible 
backgrounds [^3].
This idea is significant in new media because it challenges the old assumption that interfaces are simple platforms. 
Instead, the interface is part of the *media experience itself* and shapes how digital culture works.
