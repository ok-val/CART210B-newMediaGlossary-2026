## Bio-AI

Joanna Zylinska describes Bio-AI as the recognition that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer an external computational tool – such as software or algorithms used to analyse data, simulate systems, or solve problems – but has become embedded within the very condition of life itself; likewise Bio-AI has overtaken the role of biomachines in mediating life. She describes AI as a “relational technology to life,” suggesting that it mediates biological, ecological, and social systems rather than simply operating alongside them. Through pattern recognition, decision-making, and self-modifying processes, AI reshapes perception and reorganises the structures through which contemporary society functions.[^zylinska]

The foundations of Bio-AI can be traced to mid-20th-century in artistic expression and early computer-generated art. As Myk Eff (2023) explains, early AI art relied on simple algorithms that generated geometric patterns in early experimentation in computer-generated art, marking the intersection of artistic practice and computational logic. As computing advanced, especially with the emergence of deep learning and neural networks in the 21st century, AI systems began closely replicating biological processes. These adaptive systems analyse vast datasets, learn from feedback, and generate predictive outcomes. [^eff]

In the context of new media, Bio-AI is significant because it merges computation with biological data and living systems. Its influence is visible in AI-generated art, biometric tracking, personalised media systems, and entertainment industries, increasingly structuring around algorithmic production. [^granados]

Bio-AI therefore transforms contemporary culture from purely digital production into hybrid biological-technological systems, challenging how intelligence, creativity and social relations are perceived and defined within new media environments.
