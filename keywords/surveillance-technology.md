## Surveillance Technology

Surveillance technology is the technology, medium, and tools used to observe, track, analyze, and collect data. The surveillance can be done
on people, events, on the internet, and in public spaces. It is present in the physical and digital world. The technologies that are
crafted to do these tasks can take different forms, depending on the needs of the people, corporations, and authorities. For example, the 
tech component can be a tool to recognize face ID, a tool to recognize fingerprints, cameras, trackers, etc. It is seen in all 
kinds of environments, such as banks, airports, social media, and the internet. [^survTech]

When it comes to surveillance technology, there is a fine line on whether it is used in an ethical or non-ethical way. Ethical ways can
be when it is used to monitor employee screen activity during work, to monitor markets and finances, and to protect from fraudulent individuals
entering an establishment, to keep records of who enters and exits a space, to monitor activities in an airport, etc. It can be necessary for 
authorities to track criminals as well. Surveillance technology is a good practice when it's being used to enforce safety, to protect the population, 
and to track fraudulent activities and people. 

Although, there are rising concerns about how surveillance technology may be crossing the line because it is harming human rights. 
There were cases where the surveillance of data was taken too far; for example, surveillance technology was used to spy on political opponents 
and political activities, as mentioned on the ECCHR website. This is not a good motive for using this technology, as it can influence politcal 
outcomes unfairly. [^ECCHR] Also, corporations and governments do not disclose entirely how they use their technology to track data and monitor people. 

In the context of new media, surveillance technology is being used by social media platforms to track their users' behavior to be able 
to curate their algorithms. It is also used for safety and security with features such as facial recognition and authentication tools. 
But it is also discussed how they can take advantage and invade our privacy by collecting more data than needed. Social media collects
information regarding what their user is watching, sharing, liking, searching, etc. This alters a user's behavior and consumption 
towards that platform, as well as having impacts on their cognitive and human behaviors. [^UTS]
