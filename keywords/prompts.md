## Prompts

Prompts are natural language instructions that specify how to complete the task at hand.
This is almost always submitted by a real person to the machine, usually an artificial intelligence system which will then generate your desired output. This term is significant in new media as prompting could be viewed as a main way of having computer-human interactions within generative Ai, options like text to text, text to image, text to video, video to audio, image to video, etc. [^jingxuan23model]

Prompts are significant because it gives autonomy to the author to write a prompt never used before. Compared to early versions of generative Ai, users do not need to know how to code or do any fancy stuff. All it takes is a natural language to communicate which lowers the barrier to produce new media. Lev Manovich speaks about a similar principle about how digital objects are never fixed but exist as infinitely modifiable outputs shaped by the user's input. [^manovich01text]

The word prompt originates from the latin word promptus which means "to bring forward”. It started to be used in the English language during the mid 14th century indicating with a sense to “urge someone into action”. Then by the 15th century it was being used to describe a hint or suggestion. By the late 17th century it developed a theatrical meaning, a person who prompted an actor meant they were assisting them with forgotten lines. [^harper26last]
