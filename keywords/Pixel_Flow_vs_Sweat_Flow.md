## Pixel Flow vs Sweat Flow
---
Pixel Flow is a concept first coined and explained by writer Joanna Zylinska in her paper: BIO-AI: The Aesthetics and ethics of data animism.[^1]
It is expressing how can a machine *make* and syntesizes images. She thens put the term in contrast with the concept of sweat flow, defining 
the human tangible labour we go through in the analogous world.This contrast and opposition is exactly where both concepts find their meaning. It connects to the opposition of agency and autonomy as an 
HCI boundary.[^2] These concepts find their relevance in new media theory to better understand the constant evolving world we live in and regain power.
The distinction between how a machine can reach a flow state and how can humans reach this trans-like working mentality is where we can find
our true human agency. The world of AI is blurring this line and it can be scary to lose our sense of control or feel overwhelmed by the daily
evolution of machine models or agents. We can illsutrate this contrast of pixel vs sweat flow in an example: Pixel flow would define how
a machine, AI in this case, can create an image based on visual databases and sources. This autonomous work is the flow, the automatic 
synthesizing of visual representations. In opposition; sweat flow could be illustrated with a tile worker making a mosaic out of tangible
tiles and grout based on an image in his mind. This kind of work demands attention, care and **sweat** to execute work based on intentions and agency.
In a way, this is borrowing the concept of databases from Lee Manovich's *Database as a Symbolic Form*[^3] Because the machine or the human 
is basing his *flow* from a database, an organized information set, numerical or a human collection of found and made memories. 

**Therefore, pixel flow and sweat flow are 
opposing concepts that embodies how a human and a machine can work and think differently utilizing numerical autonomy and human agency to reach
a desirable goal.**
