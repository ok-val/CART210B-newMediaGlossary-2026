## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a process closely related to artificial intelligence, through which algorithms analyze their given training data and form the ability to make inferences about new data. As a result of this process, algorithms begin to recognize patterns (model training) and can subsequently make decisions that can result in the generation of original content. This process has been used as the backbone of various generative AI tools. The American computer scientist Arthur Samuel coined the term back in 1959.  [^bergmann25machinelearning]

There are many applications of machine learning, including scientific and medical research. It has also drastically reshaped the media landscape. Machine learning fuels social media algorithms, guiding what content each user can experience. Additionally, beginning in the 2020s, the content available online has changed as a result of an influx of AI-generated art, videos, music, and more. Many creators online condemned the use of AI in art, whereas many creators embraced AI to varying degrees in their works, whether they use it for idea production, as tools in their work, or as the final product of their project. The lack of transparency regarding the use of this technology has posed a huge problem in the media landscape, where people admonish its use in creative processes. On the other hand, generative AI has made art and creation much more accessible and allows established artists to work more efficiently and to broaden their scopes. [^valtonen2019medialiteracy]

Another issue is bias in generated content, where the model that harnesses machine learning can be unfairly influenced by its developers, its training data, etc. Furthermore, the illegal scraping of data has put major tech companies in hot water regarding their products. To this day, companies are attempting to eliminate bias and make their products more ethical, which is likely to be a problem that persists indefinitely. [^chang2024mediaresearch]
