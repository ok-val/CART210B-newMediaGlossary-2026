## Data Animism

Before delving into Data Animism, a term coined by Joanna Zylinska, it is important to first define animism itself. The concept was introduced by anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor in 1871 and described as the attribution of spirit, life, agency, or sentience to nonhuman beings, such as animals, plants, objects or natural phenomena.[^1]

Zylinska works animism into the digital sphere by extending the attribution of sentience to technology, specifically artificial intelligence. Its ability to create, reproduce and make seemingly autonomous decisions gives it a sense of agency, encouraging us to view it as more than just a tool. AI also moves us physically and emotionally, serving as a biomachine capable of channeling life through data. In doing so, it shapes how we perceive, feel and engage with the world.[^2]

This term’s significance lies in the extent to which AI has taken root in the infrastructures of our daily lives, no longer serving as an external tool but as a fundamental presence. It reshapes social organization and existential concerns, taking our data (our language, images, and behaviors) and creating new meaning, producing a feedback loop that embeds it deeper into human experience. Data Animism explains how AI is no longer simply a technology we use, but now an active participant in reorganizing life.

This can also be seen in current media practices and technologies. Some major examples of this is include:
- Generative AI: Tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and Midjourney produce language and images that feel personal and intentional, all the while being entirely algorithmic.
- Voice Assistants: Virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri blur the boundaries between ‘man’ and ‘machine’, driving users to talk to them as if they were people.[^3]
- Early Cinema: Audiences gave life to the moving images on screen, for example recoiling from the Lumière brothers' 1895 projected train.[^2]
