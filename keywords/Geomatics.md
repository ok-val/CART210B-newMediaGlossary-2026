## Geomatics

Geomatics is the term used for the study of the data and recollection of the physical impact humans and other creatures and events have on the 
closest layer of the earth. Composing studies about geography using state of the art technologies and techniques. The term was first proposed
in french by a scientist called Bernard Dubuison at the end of the 1960's mainly to reflect on changes from other jobs like surveyor or 
photogrammetrist. At the end of the 20th century it became clear that a change was needed in order to prepare for the upcoming changes to update
the gear and tactics used to record and study geographic data by merging traditional disciplines of land surveying with emerging tools for data 
capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion. In truth Geomatics is really just an umbrella term that talks about the tools and techniques used 
to analyse the Earth’s surface.[^1]

This term is used for many fields that are used in everyday life. examples like cartography, GPS services, Statistics, environmental consulting 
and many other incredibly useful domains profit from geomatics. In Canada its the Canada Center for Mapping and Earth Observation (CCMEO) is the 
institute in charge of geomatics, mapping and earth observations in Canada.[^2] Fields like land surveying are mainly used to help establish land 
boundaries that cultivate into current, legal property. Another great field that benefits from geomatics its geovisualization which is a study that 
merges computer sciences and cartography by creating hyper realistic 3D height maps of land areas.[^3] Another field that greatly benefits from this 
term is hydrogeomatics where by using emerging technologies we are able to visualize all that is above and under sea level in hopes of gathering 
useful data.

In conclusion geomatics is the term of updating pre-existing fields with new technologies and techniques to be able to gather new data that is 
useful for the modern age. Geomatics a very useful and needed domain that lets us get to know our world in a much more precise way that lets us 
take care of it in a much more effective way.
